# 0x17. C - Doubly Linked Lists

In this repository, you will find my solutions to the tasks in the **0x17-doubly_linked_lists** project of the ALX SE Foundations curriculum.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what a doubly linked list is and how to use it.
- Implement various operations such as deletion, insertion, etc., with doubly linked lists.
- Develop the ability to seek out relevant information independently.

## Requirements

- All code is written and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5).
- The code follows the Betty style.
- No global variables are used.
- Each file contains no more than 5 functions.
- Only the following standard library functions are allowed: `malloc`, `free`, `printf`, and `exit`.
- Prototypes of all functions are included in the header file `lists.h`.
- All header files are include guarded.

## Project Tasks

1. **Print list:** Write a function to print all elements of a `dlistint_t` list.
2. **List length:** Write a function to return the number of elements in a linked `dlistint_t` list.
3. **Add node:** Write a function to add a new node at the beginning of a `dlistint_t` list.
4. **Add node at the end:** Write a function to add a new node at the end of a `dlistint_t` list.
5. **Free list:** Write a function to free a `dlistint_t` list.
6. **Get node at index:** Write a function to return the nth node of a `dlistint_t` linked list.
7. **Sum list:** Write a function to return the sum of all the data (n) of a `dlistint_t` linked list.
8. **Insert at index:** Write a function to insert a new node at a given position in a linked list.
9. **Crackme4:** Find the password for crackme4 and save it in the file `100-password`.
10. **Palindromes:** Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers and save it in the file `102-result`.
11. **Crackme5:** Write a keygen for crackme5.
